# z2a
z2a means **Z**AP **to** **A**ppScan

## ABOUT THIS
It can help u using your ZAP's log import to AppScan directly.

## HOW TO USE
Just put the **ZAP's logs** that u want and **Zap_to_AppScan.py** in the same directory, and run the command.

`python Zap_to_AppScan.py`

There is no paramater that u need to set up.

And u can find some new files which is named like your ZAP's logs, but subfilename is **exd**.

Now u can import these exd files to AppScan.

So... that's all, hope u can enjoy it :)
